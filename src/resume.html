          <li>Jones originally wanted to be a National Basketball Association player
          who rapped on the side. He transferred from school to school many
          times, forcing him to only play in YMCA leagues due to transfer rules
          after the 9th Grade. Jones dropped out of high school and briefly took
          jobs at fast food restaurants. He worked at a Compaq plant and sold
          cell phones from an apartment on Antoine Drive. T. Brown, Jones's
          partner in several financial ventures, said that he sold some "dime
          bags" for six months, but the two mainly bought "T-Mobile Sidekicks"
          and sold them for an inexpensive price.
